# WoodwardBuildingGuide
 
This project is a potential application for the Touch-Screen Display on the second floor of Woodward Hall. Users will be able to find a room or office that they are looking for, and it will also be able to give them a desrciption of certain rooms like research labs.

### Features

![expaneded building](https://github.com/patkins2/WoodwardBuildingGuide/blob/master/expanded.gif)
Users will have the option to separate the building's floors in order to view a floor in greater detail. They will still be able to rotate and zoom. 

![webpages](https://github.com/patkins2/WoodwardBuildingGuide/blob/master/webpage.gif)
Users will be able to select an object that represents the room of their choice, and it will display relevent information on that room. Ideally this will be used for labs and will show information such as webpages or videos of related projects.
